To use this version:

Save the HTML content in a file named index.html.
Save the JavaScript content in a file named hangman.js in the same directory as the HTML file.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

This JavaScript version includes all the main features of the Python version:

Multiple difficulty levels and categories
SVG graphics for the hangman
A scoring system based on difficulty, time taken, and number of guesses
A leaderboard that persists between game sessions (using localStorage)
The ability to share results (simulated with an alert and clipboard copy)

The main differences are:

The game runs in a web browser instead of a console.
The leaderboard is stored in the browser's localStorage instead of a JSON file.
The UI is more interactive, with buttons and input fields instead of console prompts.
Sharing is simulated by copying the result to the clipboard instead of providing social media links.

This version provides a more visual and interactive Hangman game experience while maintaining the core gameplay and features of the Python version.
